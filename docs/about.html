								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>
									<span class="image right">
										<img src="images/data_everywhere.jpg" alt="" />
									</span>
								</p>

								<p>
									This course aims to provide students with real-world data
									science experience. Students form teams, design data science
									pipelines from the ground-up, and compete to achieve the
									highest validation accuracy on a hidden test set.
								</p>
							</section>

							<hr />
							<section>
								<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

								<p>
									Machine learning, statistics, linear algebra, and software
									engineering knowledge are essential. Courses that would
									satisfy these prerequisites include:

									<ul>
										<li>
											<a href="http://www.cs.uga.edu/courses/csci-43806380">CSCI 4380/6380</a>
										</li>
										<li>
											<a href="https://www.capa.uga.edu/cgi/Capa/BrowsePrefix_DisplayCourse.exe?32634I32634">CSCI 4360/6360</a>
										</li>
										<li>
											<a href="http://cs.uga.edu/courses/csci-40506050">CSCI 4050/6050</a>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
							</section>

								<h2>Grading</h2>
								<p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/relevant_interests.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<ul>
										<li>Projects: <strong>60%</strong></li>
										<li>Final: <strong>40%</strong></li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<p>
									There will be 3 team projects, each worth 20% of the total.
									Each project will be graded on both "theory" and "engineering"
									components. Teams will start with a grade of 85% (B); provided
									their solution adheres to a baseline standard, that is the grade
									they will receive. For more points, teams must go "above and beyond"
									the baseline.
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											The baseline theory grade will entail implementing the suggested
											strategy in each project handout. This will usually be a simple
											algorithm that, if correctly implemented, will confer a
											reasonable test performance.
										</li>
										<li>
											The baseline engineering grade will entail i) well-designed,
											modular code, ii) good documentation (in the code, in a
											README file, and on the GitHub wiki), and iii) effective
											team dynamics (division of labor in a CONTRIBUTORS file,
											good use of git commit comments, use of GitHub issue
											tracker).
										</li>
									</ul>

									Examples of going "above and beyond" include, but are not limited
									to i) implementing a sufficiently different algorithm
									(cite the paper), ii) obtaining outstanding test performance,
									iii) using continuous integration tools, iv) designing unit
									tests, v) a permissive open source license (in a LICENSE file),
									vi) a project website, vii) using linters to adhere to style
									standards, viii) creating and successfully hitting milestones
									in the issue tracker, ix) packaging your project for distribution
									(e.g. through pip or conda-forge), or x) providing outstanding
									documentation (e.g. usage examples, install instructions, a
									"quickstart" guide, comparison to other similar methods, etc).
								</p>
								<p>
									There will also be an introductory "Project 0" that aims to
									familiarize students with the technical infrastructure of the course;
									this is required but will not be graded.
								</p>

								<p>
									There will be 1 final project. Like the "regular" projects,
									it will also be team-based. Unlike the other projects, however,
									students will be able to choose the project their team works
									on. The final project consists of three components:

									<ul>
										<li>
											<strong>Proposal</strong>: A 2-page (maximum) document,
											outlining the core idea of the project, expected outcomes,
											and how success will be be evaluated. A progress update
											a few weeks after the proposal submission will be
											considered part of the proposal.
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>Presentation</strong>: A 25-minute scientific
											talk to the rest of the class, describing your project,
											your approach, and your results.
										<li>
											<strong>Deliverables</strong>: A 6-10 page
											<a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">NIPS-style</a>
											paper that thoroughly describes the complete project. This
											also includes the final code for the project.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
							</section>

								<h2>Final Project</h2>

								<p>
									<span class="image right">
										<img src="images/thatd_be_great.jpg" alt="" />
									</span>
								</p>

								<p>
									The final project is qualitatively similar to the other course projects,
									in that it is team-based and focused on some aspect of data science.
									However, students may form their own teams, and the time period for the final
									project is much longer than a course project. Therefore, with considerably
									more time and self-selected teams, more is expected.
								</p>

								<p>
									There are three main deliverables of the final project (with some small
									caveats). They are as follows:
								</p>

								<h3>Proposal (due: 3/9)</h3>
								<p>
									This officially kicks off the
									final projects by teams being announced and ideas being formalized
									in a two-page (maximum) document. This document does not need to go
									into great detail, but it should outline the major ideas for the
									project, the expected outcomes, and how success with the conclusion
									of the project will be evaluated. This should include any relevant
									references, a note of the data / methods / tools that will be used,
									and the names of the team members.
								</p>

								<p>
									There are two related items to the proposal.

									<ul>
										<li>
											<strong>Feedback</strong> (due: 3/16): The instructor will
											provide each
											team with feedback after going through the proposals. This
											feedback will enumerate any concerns or suggestions based
											on the content of the proposal. The teams are strongly
											encouraged to incorporate the suggestions (if any) into
											their ongoing work.
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>Updates</strong> (due: 4/6): Teams will submit
											update reports to the instructor, outlining the concrete
											points of progress they have made relative to the various
											objectives mentioned in their proposals. The instructor
											will use this as a gauge into the team dynamics, and allow
											the instructor one final opportunity to provide guidance
											to teams that may be struggling.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<h3>Presentations (4/18, 4/19, 4/24, 4/25)</h3>
								<p>
									Over the final class meeting periods, project teams will give
									25-minute talks on their work. These presentations should follow
									the outline of conference talks in terms of content: motivate
									the problem you are addressing and provide salient background,
									describe your approach, detail your experiments and their
									results, and put them back into the context of the problem.
								</p>

								<p>
									Teams are encouraged to be creative in how they deliver the content,
									however. This can include, but is certainly not limited to,
									live code demos or walkthroughs, web deployments, containerized
									solutions, interactive Jupyter slides, and others. Be creative!
								</p>

								<p>
									Teams will sign up for presentation slots the week before. It's
									unfortunate how the course meetings align, but the instructor
									will take into consideration the fact that some teams will present
									a full week before the final project deadline, while others
									will present only a day or two--expectations in terms of the
									relative completion of the projects at the time of the presentation
									will be adjusted accordingly. <strong>However</strong>, even
									for teams presenting the first week, the projects should still
									be 80-90% completed, with only 1-2 final experiments remaining.
								</p>

								<h3>Deliverables (due: 4/27)</h3>
								<p>
									<em>All final project deliverables are due by 11:59pm
										on Friday, April 27. This deadline is set in stone.</em>
										Deliverables can be submitted through Slack, email, or
										any other timestamped direct electronic delivery method.
								</p>

								<p>
									There are three items related to the deliverables.

									<ul>
										<li><strong>Paper</strong>: Each team should submit a full
											6-10 page <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">NIPS-style</a>
											paper that thoroughly describes the complete project. It
											should effectively summarize your complete work, and be
											in a format to submit directly to a conference or journal,
											should you wish to. <em>Please do not throw this together
											at the last minute</em>; the instructor
											will heavily penalize for grammar and syntax if it is
											unreadable, so ensure you have time to proofread before
											submitting.
										</li>
										<li><strong>Code</strong>: Each team should submit a link
											to their code repositories. Teams are encouraged to use
											the <a href="https://github.com/dsp-uga">DSP-UGA GitHub
											organization</a> to host their repositories. They are also
											encouraged to open-source their code before making final
											submissions to ensure the code is open for grading. All
											the usual expectations of code quality and accompanying
											documentation from earlier projects will be enforced.
										</li>
										<li><strong>Slides</strong>: Each team should submit the
											final versions of their presentation slides. These can
											be included as PDF/PPTX (if not too large) in a separate
											subfolder of the GitHub repository.
										</li>
									</ul>

								<h2>Materials</h2>

								<p>
									<span class="image right">
										<img src="images/grumpy_cat.jpg" alt="" />
									</span>
								</p>

								<h3>GitHub</h3>
								<p>
									All course materials will be posted here, and all project
									repositories should be created and maintained here (whether
									they are private or public is up to you, but they should
									be part of the course's GitHub organization account). You
									can access the organization account through this link:
								</p>

								<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
									<strong>
										<a href="https://github.com/dsp-uga">https://github.com/dsp-uga</a>
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
									The specific repository for the Spring 2018 course materials
									is located <a href="https://github.com/dsp-uga/sp18">here</a>.
								</p>

								<h3>AutoLab</h3>
								<p>
									This is where you submit the output of your code for each
									project (except the final project). You can access it via the
									link:
								</p>

								<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
									<strong>
										<a href="https://autolab.cs.uga.edu/">https://autolab.cs.uga.edu</a>
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
									Remember: if you have problems accessing AutoLab,
									<strong>check that you're either on UGA's campus network or
									are connected to it via VPN</strong>. If neither of these
									are true,
									<a href="https://eits.uga.edu/access_and_security/infosec/tools/vpn/">you
										can check out EITS' instructions for getting set up with VPN</a>.
									If one of them IS true, let me know and we'll see about sorting
									it out.
								</p>

								<h3>Slack</h3>

								<p>
									This is where I make will make critical course announcements,
									so please ensure you are subscribed.
								</p>

								<p>
									This is the primary point of interaction for asking for and
									offering help. I will answer questions when I can, but also
									I encourage everyone to help each other out, too!
								</p>

								<p>
									I also get inundated with emails on a daily basis, so using
									Slack to ask questions effectively acts as a filter: I'll
									most likely respond to a Slack question more quickly than I
									would by email.
								</p>

								<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
									<strong>
										<a href="https://eds-uga-csci8360.slack.com/">https://eds-uga-csci8360.slack.com/</a>

									If you are not in the Slack chat, contact me with your
									preferred email address to be invited.

								<h2>Policies</h2>

								<p>
									<span class="image right">
										<img src="images/hermione.jpg" alt="" />
									</span>
								</p>

								<p>
									Projects are due by 11:59:59pm on the noted date; after that
									time, AutoLab will no longer accept submissions. Furthermore,
									no commits to GitHub repositories after the stated time will
									be considered when grading.
								</p>

								<p>
									If you run into problems with your teammates, you first need
									to work with them and determine a course of action that is
									beneficial for everyone. If you and your teammates are still
									unable to reach a consensus, I am happy to help. But the
									bottom line is: your entire team sinks or swims together.
									There are no individual grades on the projects, so work with
									each other, not against one another.
								</p>

								<p>
									The presence or absence of any form of help or collaboration,
									whether given or received, must be explicitly stated and
									disclosed in full by all involved, on the first page of their
									assignment ("I did not give or receive any help on this
									assignment" or "I helped [person] with [specific task].").
									Collaboration without full disclosure will be handled
									severely; except in usual extenuating circumstances, my
									policy is to fail the student(s) for the entire course.
								</p>

								<p>
									The simple version is: don't copy code or even previous
									solutions. Given the nature of this course and the need for
									ground-truth data on the verification end, chances are high
									you can find similar projects in the wild. Resist that urge;
									it will be obvious, and we'll have to have an awkward
									conversation that won't end well.
								</p>

								<p>DO NOT COPY CODE. Don't do it.</p>
